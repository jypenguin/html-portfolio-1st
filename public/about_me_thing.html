<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name's Joy, and I am a 14 year old that goes to Strath Haven High School. 
  I live with my parents and have one younger brother named Jayden (go check his 
  portfoilio out!) I don't have any pets, though if I could I would like a cat or a hamster.
</p>

<p>I like to read and draw. My favorite fiction books to read are usually fantasy, science fiction,
  and mystery novels. Memoirs and humorous/interesting nonfiction books are nonfiction books I enjoy.
  However, most of the time I'll be happy with any book. As for drawing, I usually pick something from
  the internet and draw it. I mostly work with pencils and color pencils.
